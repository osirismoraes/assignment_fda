### Running the Notebook

_Basic Steps_

Start the notebook server from the command line:

"""
jupyter notebook
"""

You should see the notebook open in your browser.

Jupyter Notebook files are very useful. Its interface allows you to navigate using your mouse with dropdown menus and buttons, or by keyboard shortcuts. They allow you to run small segments of code at a time, save them in their current state, or restart and have them return to their original state.In addition to running code, we can also use markdown to neatly organize our notebooks so they are presentable to others.
